## Learn Next.js

Welcome to the Next.js App Router course! In this free interactive course, you'll learn the main features of Next.js by building a full-stack web application.
What we'll be building
Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop and mobile versions.

For this course, we'll be building a simplified version of the financial dashboard that has:

    A public home page.
    A login page.
    Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
    The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.

The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which you'll set up in a later chapter.

By the end of the course, you'll have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.

##Folder structure

You'll notice that the project has the following folder structure:
Folder structure of the dashboard project, showing the main folders and files: app, public, and config files.

    /app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
    /app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
    /app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
    /public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
    Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.
